# ScarletHawkReviews (project name TBD)

## Scope/Outline
Team 4's goal with this web application is to create a rating platform for courses which is simple and easy to use. To do this we are streamlining the features in the appllication to make the user experience more pleasent and enjoyable. We will implement basic features like:

1. Login page (changing UI, etc)
2. Help page (ability to contact devs)
3. Homepage (searching capabilities)
4. Course page (showing previous reviews and selected)
5. Review page (where user leaves their review)
6. About us page (team info)

## General function
This web application will serve as a way to rate courses at IIT. These ratings will be star oriented and have text descriptions users can use to describe their experience. Users will be able to create their own accounts, leave ratings, view other ratings, etc. Also each course will not show which professor is teaching and will be up to the student to describe their experience (due to professors changing quite frequently). This application has similarities to other academic rating sites, however, our main intention behind this app is to serve students specifically at IIT.
