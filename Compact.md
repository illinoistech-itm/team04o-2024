# Project Charter

## Workflow
Team 4 (online section) will be implementing a normal agile software/system development life cycle. Going through steps such as: planning (role allocation, brainstorming, etc), analysis, design (wireframes, drawings, etc), implementation (code, UI/UX), testing (using implemented code or designs), and maintenance (if web app is used past this course). To acheive all of this we will communicate freuqently over discord to dictate who does what task and then use git to log our progress as we make the web app on GitHub (team repo).

## Communication
Team 4 will be using Discord as our main means of communication, utilizing servers and direct messaging to interact with individual group members and the team as a whole. Our group has agreed on meeting every Tuesday at 6:00pm CST and some Thursdays if the extra time is needed.

## Consequences
Team 4 will be meeting and communicating somewhat frequently, so due to this, missing such communications and meetings will result in:

1. First: A message outlining group communications, meeting times, and other intentions.
2. Second: The PM reaching out to Professor Hajek and we attempt to find a solution.
3. Third: Separation from the group.

(Three strike system)

## Restoration Methods
If a team member has gotten to the point of two strikes, then the PM and Mr. Hajek will work out a way to have the member contribute sufficently to the group. If no solution can be found then the member will be removed from the group.
